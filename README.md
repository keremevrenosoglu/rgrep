# rgrep
rgrep_matches function inside of matcher.c is utilized by rgrep.c in order to compare each line of input with the given pattern. The function returns 1 if the pattern is found in the current line, 0 otherwise. Any line that returned 1 is outputted by rgrep.c. Input can range from a phrase in the command line to numerous blocks of text provided from a file. Examples can be tested through Makefile. As mentioned, certain characters of the entered pattern have special meaning, namely '.', '+', '?', and '\\'. A '.' will match with any character. The character in front of a '+' can be repeated consecutively any number of times. The character before a '?' may or may not appear. '\\' placed before any of these including itself alleviates the unique handling they hold otherwise. For instance, a pattern of ".s+r?\+" would return 1 when tested against the line "fss+".
